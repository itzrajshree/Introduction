🏫 I am a second-year Bachelor's in computer science technology student and love to solve real-life problems. 
✏️ This passion goes into the field of content writing as well, like correcting everyone's grammar:)
💃🏽 My hobbies include reading books, drinking coffee, dancing mindlessly and listening to Lo-fi music!
✈️ Being an enthusiastic traveller, I love to travel to new places and experience their diverse culture and food.
✨ I am not afraid of trying new things, so I try to manage whatever life throws at me and make the best out of it!
